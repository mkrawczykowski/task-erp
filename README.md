# (almost) Pixel perfect recruitment assignment - Wordpress website with Gutenberg

I was granted permission to publish the result website of recruitment assignment. I haven't used Gutebnberg blocks before, but created some simple custom blocks using ACF Pro.
To make things simpler I focused on creating only desktop and mobile views.

- coded from Figma project
- (almost) pixel perfect
- SASS + BEM
- WP REST API
- Wordpress
- DRY PHP code
- custom Gutenberg blocks built with ACF Pro
- Webpack

- ## Exported PNGs from Figma project
